IN THE STRAIT OF BONIFACIO
1 CATEGORIES OF SHIPS REQUIRED TO PARTICIPATE IN THE SYSTEM
Ships of 300 gross tonnage and over are required to participate in the system.
2 GEOGRAPHICAL COVERAGE OF THE SYSTEM - REFERENCE CHART
The reporting system covers a circular area with a radius of 20 (twenty) nautical miles centred on
Bonifacio.   The reference chart is the French Chart No.7024 of the SHOM (Hydrographic and
Oceanographic Service of the French Navy) International chart No.3350.
3 FORMAT  AND CONTENTS OF THE REPORT, TIMES AND GEOGRAPHICAL POSITIONS FOR
SUBMITTING REPORT, AUTHORITY TO WHOM REPORTS SHOULD BE SENT, AVAILABLE SERVICES
3.1 Content
The report required shall include:
- information considered essential:
- the name of the ship, her callsign or IMO identification umber (letter A)
- time and position (letters C or D)
- course and speed (letters E and F)
- draught (letter O)
- additional information, if appropriate
- cargo (in case of transport of petroleum products, dangerous or polluting substances)

In addition, in accordance with provisions of SOLAS and MARPOL Conventions, ships must report
information on any defect, damage, deficiency or limitations as well as, if necessary, information relating
to pollution incidents or loss of cargo.  Possession of this information enables the operators to broadcast
safety messages to other ship traffic and to ensure more effective tracking of the trajectories of ships
concerned.
