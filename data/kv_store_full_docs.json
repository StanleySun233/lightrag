INTRODUCTION  \n \nEffective communication is an essential component for operations in the maritime environment and is achieved \nwhen the intended meaning of the sender and the perceived meaning of the receiver is the same.  \nThe use of standard messaging structure and phrases enables us to communicate quickly and effectively despite differences in language and reduces the risk  for misunderstanding.  \nThese principles are essential for the safe and efficient communication , noting: \n• IMO Resolution A.1158( 32) Guideline s for vessel traffic services  [1] states:  \n“VTS communications should be timely, clear, concise and unambiguous. ”.  \n• IMO Resolutio n A.918(22) IMO Standard Marine Communication P hrases  [2] states: \n“As navigational and safety communications from ship to shore and vice versa, from ship to ship, and on board ship must be precise, simple and unambiguous so as to avoid confusion and error, there is a need to standard ize the language used.” \n• IALA Recommendation R1012 VTS Communications  [3] states: \n“The level of safety and efficiency in the movement of maritime traffic within an area covered by a vessel traffic service would be enhanced by ensuring that VTS communications are harmon ized through standard \nphraseology, procedures and technology for the delivery of precise, simple and unambiguous commun ications \nto the bridge team and allied services.”   \nStandard message structure and phra seology reduce the risk that a message will be misunderstood and aids the \nread -back  process so that any error is quickly detected. Ambiguous or non -standard phrases are  frequent causal \nor contributory factors in marine casualty, incident and near miss situations . \n2. DOCUMENT PURPOSE \n \nThe purpose of this guideline is to assist authorities imp lement practices specified in IALA Recommendation R1012 \nVTS Communications  associated with ensuring VTS communications are harmoniz ed through the use of standard \nmessage structure and phrases to:  \n• Facilitate clear, concise, and unambiguous communications th at are timely and effective.  \n• Minim ize misunderstanding of the intent of messages and reduc e the time required for effective \ncommunication.  \n• Mitigate complacency amongst VTS personnel .  \n2.1. RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER DOCUMENTS \n \nThis Guideline , G1132 VTS Voice Communications and Phraseology, is associated with Recommendation R1012 VTS \nCommunications , a normative provision of IALA Standard S1040 Vessel Traffic Services  [4]. To demonstrate \ncompliance with the Recommendation the provisions of this Guideline need to be implemented.  \n \n \n \nIALA Guideline  G1132 VTS Voice Communications and Phraseology   \nEdition 2.2  urn:mrn:iala:pub:g1132:ed2.2  P 7 The Guideline will also assist:  \n• VTS authorities  prepare standardi zed operating procedures for communication and should be read in \nconjunction with IALA Guideline  G1141 Operational Procedures for Vessel Traffic Services  [5]. \n• VTS Tra ining organ izations incorporate the use of standard VTS phraseology into their course \ncurriculums.   \n3. DOCUMENT STRUCTURE  \n \nThis document consists of three parts:  \n• Part A sets out the general pr inciples for VTS Communications;  \n• Part B provides more general guidance on message composition, delivery and interpretatio n; and \n• Part C identifies a number of standard phrases for use in VTS operations.  \n4. PART A  GENERAL PRINC IPLES OF VTS COMMUNICATIONS  \n \n4.1. INTERNATIONAL / NATIONAL OBLIGATIONS  \n \nITU Radio R egulations [6] require shore -based operators to be appropriately qualified:  \n“No. 48. 1     § 1    Administrations shall ensure that the staff on duty in coast stations and in co ast \nearth stations are adequately qualified to operate the stations efficiently. ” \nVTS personnel  should  hold appropriate national qualifications to operate the VHF marine radiotelephony \nequipment. These qualifications should include operating procedures rel ating to d istress , urgency , safety  and \nroutine communications . \n4.2. LANGUAGE  \n \nEnglish language should be used for all VTS communications with ships  and allied services unless use of an \nalternative language has been agreed. If an alternative language be used, VT S personnel should be mindful that not \nall participants may understand what is being communicated.  \n4.3. CONSIST ENCY  \n \nAttention should be given to the correct use of phraseology where applicable to establish efficient, clear, concise, \nand unambiguous communicati ons.  \nVTS Authorities should implement appropriate procedures to ensure the consistent and correct use of VTS phraseology in all instances in which they are applicable.  \n4.4. IMPORTANCE OF USING STANDARD PHRASEOLOGY  \n \nThe use of standard phraseology is important in order to avoid : \n \n \n \nIALA Guideline  G1132 VTS Voice Communications and Phraseology   \nEdition 2.2  urn:mrn:iala:pub:g1132:ed2.2  P 8 • The receiver/s not hear ing the message correctly. When the standard phrases were adopted, \nconsideration was given to choosing words and phrases that sound distinctly different and therefore \ncannot be confused under any readability circumstances.  \n• The receiver/s not understand ing the message. This may be due to e.g. , using phrasal verbs or other \nwords that are not commonly known. The different levels of knowledge of the English language contributes to this as well.  \n• Ambiguit y, i.e. , the transmitting person may mean one thing and the re ceiving person may understand \nsomething else.  \n• The message ha ving to be repeated, resulting in delay in response and frequency congestion . \n• Parts of the message be ing incorrectly acted upon.  \n4.5. CULTURAL DIFFERENCES  \n \nDiffering cultural experiences and backgrounds may result in different responses to situations. A lack of awareness of these differences could increase the possibility of errors and misunderstandings.  \nW\nhen VTS personnel communicate cross -c\nulturally special attention should be made to:  \n• S\nhare crucial information with ships to create a common perception of potential dangers, even if this \ninformation seems “obvious ”. \n• U\nse closed loop (or Read -b\nack) techniques when information may be misunderstood such as the \nnumber of persons on -b\noard or inf ormation that would benefit others using the VTS area, instructions \nor advice.  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nIALA Guideline  G1132 VTS Voice Communications and Phraseology   \nEdition 2.2  urn:mrn:iala:pub:g1132:ed2.2  P 9 5. PART B  MESSAGE COMP ILATION , DELIVERY AND INTERPRETATION  \n \n5.1. COMPILING A MESSAGE  \n \nThe purpose of standard phraseology is to convey information or instructions unambiguously to a  specific recipient \nor recipients. Use of standard format and content will help to achieve this purpose.  \nStandard phrases are identified in Part C for use in operational circumstances where time may be critical or where \nmisunderstandings might comprom ize safety,  however  there will be many situations where such urgency does not \napply and no standard phrase has been identified.  In such circumstances, plain language1 or locally adopted phrases \nshould be used following the general guidance on phraseology below.  \n5.1.1.  MESSAGE  STRUCTURE \nMessage structure provides the framework to convey information or instructions unambiguously us ing a standard \nformat and content structure.  \nRadio communications messages should have the structure  as shown in Table 1 : \nTable 1  Radio communications message structure  \n1. Establish contact  (Name of ship /Call sign) this is \n(name) VTS   \n2. Exchange information a. Message marker  See 5.1.2 M essage markers  \n b. Phrase(s)   \n3. End of message  Over  When expecting a reply  \n4. End of conversation  Out When expecting no reply  \n \nNote  (1): F urther information is available in Recommendation ITU-R M.1171: Radiotelephony procedures in the \nmaritime mobile service (M.1171 -0 (10/95)) [6] and IMO Resolution A.954(23) Proper use of VHF Channels  at sea  \n[4]. Note (2) : All relevant ITU r egulations for the maritime service are contained in the ITU’s Manual for use by the \nMaritime Mobile and Maritime Mobile -Satellite Services (Maritime Manual)  [8], which is required to be held on -\nboard every ship.  \nThere are some general rules for construction and content of messages, which should be considered:  \n• Use message markers . \n• Use standard phraseology. Some standard phrases and the message intent are detailed in Part C . \n• Avoid unnecessary words (e.g. , “what time do you think your ETA is at the pilot station, thank you ”, \nshould be: “ what is your ETA at the pilot station ”). \n• Keep the subject, verb, and object as near to one another as possible.  \n• Use the active form (such as “INFORMATION. S hip BRAVO is overtaking you” instead of passive \n“INFORMATION . You are being overtaken by ship BRAVO ). \n• The use of action word s (e.g. , PROCEED) should come before the condition (e.g. , time or location). \n \n \n1  Plain language is writing that is clear, concise, well -organized, and follows other best practices appropriate to the subject or field and intended audience.  \n \n \n \nIALA Guideline  G1132 VTS Voice Communications and Phraseology   \nEdition 2.2  urn:mrn:iala:pub:g1132:ed2.2  P 10 • Each phrase should contain only one topic.  \n• A maximum of two message markers and two phrases should be used in one transmission to avoid an \noverload on the recipient . \n• Information m ust be relevant, as accurate as possible and timely.  \n•  Spell out words using the phonetic alphabet (Section 5.1.3) and use phonetic numbers (Section 5.1.4) as \nrequired for the names of buoys, stations, call signs etc.  \n• Ships should be clearly identified (e.g., by name and call sign)  and i t may also be beneficial to identify by \nship type, for example “ container ship Maersk Rotterdam ”. In many cases, the message element will be \npreceded by the identity of the ship about which information is being provided.  \n5.1.2.  MESS AGE  MARKERS \nTo facilitate shore -to-ship and ship -to-shore communications, message markers should be used to increase the \nprobability of the purpose of the message being properly understood.  \nMessage markers increase the effectiveness and urgency of VHF com munications as required and may help \nemphasize  the content of the message or to ensure that the message will be properly understood. Whilst the use \nof message markers is not obligatory, their general use is good practice and VTS  personnel  should apply these \ndepending on the assessment of the situation. Their use is strongly recommended when a d egree of stress or \nurgency exists, when there are language difficulties and when re sponding to unsafe situations.  \nThere are eight message markers as defin ed in IMO Resolution A.918(22) Standard Marine Communication Phrases \n(SMCP)  [2]. Seven of them are frequently used by VTS and are explained in more de tail below. The message marker \nshould be spoken preceding the message or the corresponding part of t he message.  \n5.1.2.1.  Information  \nThis indicates that the following message is restricted to observed facts, situations etc.  \nVTS INFORMATION. Water level at breakwater is 4 metres.  \n \nVTS INFORMATION. Container Ship Maersk Dusseldorf [position] inbound and \nwill take tugs at Swanson Dock swing basin.  \n \nNote: This marker is normally used for navigational and traffic information, etc.  Information is to assist on -board  \ndecision -making process.  \n5.1.2.2.  Advice  \nThis indicates that the following message implies the intention of the sender to influence others and may i nclude a \nrecommendation.  \nVTS INFORMATION . Container Ship Maersk Dusseldorf [position] inbound and \nwill take tugs at Swanson Dock swing basin.  \nVTS ADVICE. Reduce to safe speed .  \n Note: The decision whether to follow the ADVICE still stays with the recipient. ADVICE does not necessarily have to \nbe followed but should be considered very carefully.  \n5.1.2.3.  Warning  \nThis indicates that the following message implies the intention of the sender to alert others to potential dangers.  \n \n \n \nIALA Guideline  G1132 VTS Voice Communications and Phraseology   \nEdition 2.2  urn:mrn:iala:pub:g1132:ed2.2  P 11 VTS WARNING. You are approaching  shallow water distance 6 cables.  \n \nNote: This means that any recipient of a WARNING should pay immediate attention to the danger mentioned and \nconfirm the ship ’s position, course and speed in relation to the warning. Consequences are up to the recipient.  \n5.1.2.4.  Instruction  \nThis indicates that the following message implies the intention of the sender to  direct the action of others .  \nIn a VTS area, ships should comply with instructions given to the ship by a VTS unless contradictory safety and/or \nmarine environment protection reasons exist . Masters may be required to report on their actions should they \ndecide to disr egard any instruction given by a VTS.    \nIt is important, therefore, that when an instruction is issued by a VTS it has the appropriate reg ulatory status and \nauthority  to do so . \nVTS  INSTRUCTION.  Remain West of No 1 Buoy until ship X has passed.  \n5.1.2.5.  Question  \nThis indicates that the following message is of interrogative character.  \nVTS QUESTION. What is your maximum draft?  \n5.1.2.6.  Answer  \nThis indicates that the following message is the reply to a previous question.  An answer should not contain another \nquestion.  \nVTS ANSWER. Pilot boarding 0800.  \n5.1.2.7.  Request  \nThis indicates that the following message is asking for action from others with respect to the ship  and signals that \nsomething is to be arranged o r provided. Request should not be used involving navigation or to modify the \nConvention on the  International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea, 1972  (COLR EGs) [8]. \nVTS REQUEST.  Wait for pilot at (location) . \n5.1.2.8.  Intention \nThis message marker indicates that the following message informs others about immediate navigational action that is intended to be taken. The use of this message marker is logically restricted to ships  and is not to be used by VTS . \n  \n \n \n \nIALA Guideline  G1132 VTS Voice Communications and Phraseology   \nEdition 2.2  urn:mrn:iala:pub:g1132:ed2.2  P 12 5.1.3.  PHONETIC  ALPHABET  \nThe phonetic alphabet is used to distinguish between letters, which sound similar when transmitted over the radio.  \nThey are commonly used when transmitting call signs and in cases where a single letter is used to designate \nsomething.  \nPronunciation of the phone tic alphabet is as shown in Table 2 : \nTable 2  Phonetic alphabet and pronunciation  \nLetter  Spelling  Pronunciation   Letter  Spelling  Pronunciation  \nA Alpha  al fah  N November  no vem  bar \nB Bravo brah  voh  O Oscar oss cah \nC Charlie  char  lee  P Papa  pah \nD Delta  dell tah  Q Quebec  keh beck  \nE Echo  eck ho  R Romeo  row  me oh \nF Foxtrot  foks trot  S Sierra  see air rah \nG Golf  golf  T Tango  tang  go \nH Hotel  hoh tel  U Uniform  you nee form  \nI India  in dee a  V Victor  vik tah \nJ Juliet  jew lee ett  W Whiskey  wiss  key \nK Kilo key loh  X X-ray ecks  ray \nL Lima  lee mah   Y Yankee  yang  key \nM Mike  mike  Z Zulu zoo loo \n5.1.4.  PHONETIC  NUMBERS  [NUMERALS]  \nNumbers are to be spoken in separate digits.  For example:  \n“ wun fife zeero ” for 150  \nPronunciation of numbers shall be in the phonetic form as shown in  Table 3  : \nTable 3  Phonetic numbers and pronunciation  \nNumber  Spelling  Pronunciation    Spelling  Pronunciation  \n0 zero  zeero    Decimal  day see mal  \n1 one wun    Hundred  hun dred  \n2 two too   Thousand  tou sand  \n3 three  tree      \n4 four fower      \n5 five fife     \n6 six six     \n7 seven  seven      \n8 eight  ait     \n \n \n \nIALA Guideline  G1132 VTS Voice Communications and Phraseology   \nEdition 2.2  urn:mrn:iala:pub:g1132:ed2.2  P 13 Number  Spelling  Pronunciation    Spelling  Pronunciation  \n9 nine  niner      \n \n5.1.5.  POSITIONS  \nPosition s may be passed either in latitude and longitude or relative to a mark.  In considering which method is most \nappropriate, the sender should recogni ze that the recipient will first have to plot a position passed in latitude and \nlongitude in order to assimilat e the information.  \nWhen latitude and longitude are used, these shall be expressed in d egrees and minutes (and decimals of a minute \nif necessary), north or south of the Equator, and East or West of zero degrees longitude.  \nVTS WARNING. Dangerous wreck reported in position 15 d egrees 34 minutes \nNorth, 61 degrees 29 minutes West.  \n \nWhen the position is related to a mark, the mark should be a defined charted object.  \n VTS WARNING. Fishing vessel not under command bearing 120 degrees from \nFairway Buoy 1.2 nautical miles.  \n \n5.1.6.  BEARINGS  \nThe bearing of the mark or ship concerned is the bearing using 360 d egree notation from True North unless \notherwise stated.  Bearings may be either from  the mark or from  the ship. \nVTS INFORMATION . Pilot boat is bearing 215 d egrees from you.  \n 5.1.7.  \nCOURSE  \nAs a general term, “Course” refers to the intended direction of movement of a ship  through the water. Unless it is \nintended to use this term in a general sense, one of the specific descriptors below should normally be used by VTS \nand expressed in 360 -degree notation from True North unless otherwise stated.  A mariner will not normally use  a \ndecimal course ( i.e., course 162.3 d egrees identified on the VTS Decision Support Tool (DST) would be referred to \n162 d egrees when stated over the radio). See Table 4 : \nTable 4  Course descriptors  \nCourse Made \nGood  That course which a ship  has made good over ground, as a result of the effect of currents, \ntidal streams and leeway.  \nCourse to Make Good  That course which a ship is to make good over ground, after allowing for the effect of \ncurrents, tidal streams, and leeway.  \nTrack  The path followed between one position and another.  \nPlanned Track  The path to be followed between one position and another.  \nHeading  The horizontal direction of the vessel's bows at a given moment  meas ured in degrees \nclockwise from True North . \n \nExample:  \nVTS ADVICE .

DISTANCES  \nTo be expressed in nautical miles or cables (tenths of a  nautical mile), the unit is always to be stated.  \n5.1.9.  SPEED  \nTo be expressed in knots  (nautical mile per hour) .  \n‘Speed’ refers to speed through the water. If speed over the ground is intended, then this should be stated as ‘Speed \nover the Ground’ (SOG).  \n5.1.10.  TIME  \nTime should be given in local time in a 24 hour format.  Mariners do not usually add the suffix “hours”.  \n5.1.11.  GEOGRAPHICAL  NAMES  \nPlace names should be those that are on navigational charts and publications.  \nWhere this is not available then latitude and longitude should be used.  \n5.1.12.  ABBREVIATIONS  \nAbbreviations will often save time in sp eech. Many abbreviations are so commonly used in normal speech they  are \nmore familiar than the original, unabbreviated form  (i.e., radar) . Abbreviations  in radio transmissions may be used  \nprovided that:  \n• they are quicker and easier to use than the full word  (e.g. , ETA/ETD in place of Estimated Time of \nArrival/ Estimated Time of Departure) ; \n• they are sufficiently well known to avoid any confusion and subsequent confirmatory transmissions ; and  \n• if there is any confusion, the full term is readily substituted.  \n5.2. DELI VERING A MESSAGE  \n \nVTS communications should be professional, clear, concise , consistent,  and accurate.  \nSpeech and vocal patterns should be adjusted in order to increase the likelihood of mutual understanding r egardless \nof experience or native language.  \n5.2.1.  PREPARATION  WHEN  USING  VHF \nThe proper use of VHF equipment is essential if transmissions are to be successful. In particular:  \n• VTS personnel should consider the volume and positioning of the microphone.  \n• It is important to listen on the channel before transmitting to ensure there will be no interferences from another station.  \n• A brief pause is normally required before starting to speak there may be a delay in transmission after pressing the press to transm it (PTT) button.  \n5.2.2.  \nTONE  AND  VOLUME  \nThe tone of the voice is crucial for mutual understanding. A message should be supported by the tone of voice used. Research has indicated that how words are expressed is just as important as what words are used.  \nTransmiss ions should be sent with a  polite  tone of calm confidence, and professionalism. VTS personnel must \nalways remain professional even if they receive overly  familiar or aggressive transmissions.  \n \n \n \nIALA Guideline  G1132 VTS Voice Communications and Phraseology   \nEdition 2.2  urn:mrn:iala:pub:g1132:ed2.2  P 15 The volume of the voice is important. The volume of a transmission should be at a level used for normal \nconversation. Shouting is unprofessional and causes distortion, whilst speaking too quietly could result in the message not being heard.  \n5.2.3.  \nEMPHASIS  ON  KEYWORDS  \nThe keyword is the most important part of the message. This should be spoken slightly louder  and longer than its \nneighbouring words to provide emphasis (e.g. , WARNING SHALLOW water AHEAD of you).  \n5.2.4.  SPEECH  RATE  \nSpeech rate is the speed at which a speaker conveys the message. Key points for speech rate ar e: \n• Modulating speech at a slower rate of around 120 words per minute ( WPM ) is highly recommended for \nclear and effective communication. \n• In\n emergency situations and in developing unsafe situations, a slower rate of 100 WPM should be \napplied so important inf ormation can be clearly and accurately delivered under high -p\nressure and \ncognitively challenging conditions.  \nI\nn an international environment where people from different linguistic backgrounds speak with their own accents, \nintonation and pronunciation, it is crucial to maintain an appropriate rate of speech . This increases the likelihood \nof comprehension and reduces anxiety . \n5.2.5.  WORD  GROUPING  AND  PAUSING  \nIt is generally recogniz ed that the use of four words in a short phrase is best understood by listeners. Ther efore, \nunderstanding can be enhanced considerably by dividing sentences into smaller groups , or phrases , and by pausing \nbriefly between word groups. VTS personnel can also moderate their speech rates by pausing between each word group.  \nThe effect of word g rouping and pausing is important for the following reasons:  \n• It gives listeners the time to process each pack of information that is delivered.  \n• It enables speakers to prepare subsequent information for delivery.  \n• It decreases the use of unnecessary fillers like ‘um, hm, uh, …’, which hinders mutual intelligibility.  \nVTS INFORMATION . (pause)  Container ship Stardust (pause)  not under command \nin position (pause)  2.1 nautical miles (pause)  southeast from Morrison \nlighthouse (pause) … \n 1 word+(pause)+3 words+(pause)+5 words+(pause)+5 words+(pause)  +4 \nwords+(pause)  \n5.2.6.  QUESTIONING  TECHNIQUES  \nInformation flow within a VTS is paramount.  A VTS often gathers and disseminates information based on real time \nsituations within the VTS area. In the computer world the term ‘garbage in, garbage out’ is often used. The same \napplies to VTS communications, if you ask the wrong questions,  you will probably get the wrong answer.  \nTo ensure effective questioning the following techniques should be used: \n• Closed Questions  \n• Open Questions  \n• Funnel Questions  \n5.2.6.1.  Closed questions  \nA closed question usually receives a one -word answer, or a short factual statement.  \n \n \n \nIALA Guideline  G1132 VTS Voice Communications and Phraseology   \nEdition 2.2  urn:mrn:iala:pub:g1132:ed2.2  P 16 VTS QUESTION. Do you have any defects?  \n \nVTS QUESTION. Are you able to see the entrance beacon?  \n5.2.6.2.  Open questions  \nGenerally open questions deliberately seek longer answers and are the opposite of closed questions.  Open \nquestions usually contain terms to elicit further information.  \nVTS QUESTION. What is the nature of your problem?  \n \n5.2.6.3.  Funnel questions  \nThis questioning technique involves the use of a series of questions. Initially general questions are asked which \nincrease in detail with each subsequent question.  With funnel questioning it may be useful to start with one or \nmore closed questions before follow ing up with more open questions.  \nVTS QUESTION. Do you see  the Princes Inner Buoy?  \nVTS QUESTION. Is the buoy lit?  \nVTS QUESTION. Is the buoy in the correct position?  \nVTS QUESTION. Describe the damage?  \n5.2.7.  AMBIGUOUS  TERMINOLOGY  \nSome words in English have meanings depending on the context in which they appear.  Misunderstandings \nfrequently occur, especially in VTS communications, and have resulted in accidents.  \nThe use of local terminology should be avoided as this can lead to confusion.  For example:  \nMAY/MIG HT \nDo not  say: “You may/might enter the fairway” . \nSay: “ANSWER.  You have permission to enter the fairway” . \nSHOULD  \nDo not  say: “You should anchor in anchorage Z4” . \nSay: “ADVICE. Anchor in anchorage Z4” . \nCOULD  \nDo not  say: “You could be running into danger” . \nSay: “WARNING.  You are running into danger” . \nCAN  \nThe word “CAN” describes the possibility, or the capability of doing something.   \nDo not  say: “Can  you adjust  your ETD from the berth by 20 minutes?”  \nSay: “QUESTION.  Are you able to adjust your ETD 20 minutes earlier ?”  \n5.2.8.  RESPONSES \nWhen the answer to a closed question is in the affirmative or n egative, consider the need to repeat the appropriate \nphrase or add an explanation in the response.  \nFor a response in t he affirmative say:  \n \n \n \nIALA Guideline  G1132 VTS Voice Communications and Phraseology   \nEdition 2.2  urn:mrn:iala:pub:g1132:ed2.2  P 17 “Yes…” followed by the appropriate phrase . \nFor a response in the n egative, say:  \n“No…” followed by the appropriate phrase . \nWhere a message is received and only acknowledgement of receipt is needed, say “ received ”.  \nIf information requested is not immediately available, advise the caller to “Stand by” and consider the need to \nindicate the time interval within which the information will be available.  \n5.2.9.  CORRECTIONS  \nWhen an error is made in a message, say:  \n“Correction” plus the corrected part of the message.  \nVTS Pilot boarding time 1400.  \nCORRECTION - pilot boarding time 1430. \n5.2.10.  REPETITION  \nWhen communication is difficult, phrases or words may be transmitted twice. If any part of a message is considered \nsufficiently important, the message should  be repeated using the appropriate phrase:  \n“Repeat” followed by the corresponding part of the message.  \nVTS The tide is 1.2m – REPEAT – The tide is 1.2m . \n \nWhen the message is not properly heard, say:  \n“Say again”.   \n5.2.11.  DISTRESS  AND  SAFETY  COMMUNICATIONS  \nGuidance on distress and safety communications is provided in the ITU publication Radio R egulations Volume 1 \n(2020) Chapter VII. [6]This includes distr ess (MAYDAY), urgency (PAN PAN) and safety (SECURIT É) calls and \nmessages and operational procedures for such calls over Digital Selective Calling ( DSC) or voice channels.  \nMore detailed guidance is published by IMO in the GMDSS Manual [10]  which includes:  \n• “distress, … urgency … and safety …. communications shall have absolute priority over all other \ntransmissions”.  \n• “All stations which receive a distress alert or a call transmitted on the distress and safety frequencies … \nshall immediately cease any transmission capable of interfering, …. set watch on the radiotelephone \nfrequency associated  …. and prepare for subsequen t traffic”.  \n• “Coast station … in receipt of distress alerts or distress calls shall ensure that they are routed as soon as \npossible to a rescue coordination centre”.  \nA VTS may receive distress and safety communications (e .g., VTS working channel or VHF chan nel 16).  VTS \npersonnel should, therefore, be trained and practiced in responding to distress and safety communications.  \n5.3. HOW TO INTERPRET A MESSAGE  \n \nInterpretation of the message requires skills such as encoding in order to achieve effective communications . Just \nas confusion can arise from errors in encoding, it can also arise from decoding especially during emergency \nsituations. There could be a number of reasons (internal/external factors) that influence the decoding procedures which should be considered,  see Figure 1 below.  \n \n \n \nIALA Guideline  G1132 VTS Voic e Communications and Phraseology   \nEdition 2.2  urn:mrn:iala:pub:g1132:ed2.2  P 18  \nFigure 1  Communication process  \n5.3.1.  EFFECTIVE  LISTENING  SKILLS  \nEffective listening skills are used to actively understand information provided by the speaker and it can be \ncategorized into the following steps:  \n5.3.1.1.  Listening  \nListening involves the reception of sounds from the sender by:  \n• avoiding interruptions ; \n• clearing one's mind of distractions ; and  \n• focus ing on the speaker.  \n5.3.1.2.  Clarity  \nThe sender and receiver both have a responsibility to ensure that what is said is understood:  \n• Ask open questions to pr obe for further detail if required.  \n• Avoid asking leading questions.  \n• Avoid coming to conclusions before the sender finishes.  \n• Be aware of the sender’s choice and application of words.  \n• Encourage feedback through questioning.  \n5.3.1.3.  Interpretation \nInterpretation not only requires verification of what the sender has said, but also the understanding of the information given.  \nSteps to ensure understanding are:  \n• Communicate your interpretation and verify its accuracy.  \n• Identify the main issues.  \n• Do not ass ume what the sender will say, particularly when receiving routine communications.  \n\n \n \n \nIALA Guideline  G1132 VTS Voice Communications and Phraseology   \nEdition 2.2  urn:mrn:iala:pub: g1132:ed2.2  P 19 5.3.2.  CLOSED  LOOP  COMMUNICATIONS  [READ -BACK]  \nMisunderstandings in messages received may include half -heard words or guessed -at numbers. The potential for \nmisunderstanding increases  with the complexity of messages and may cause the bridge team to:  \n• accept inadequate information received; or  \n• determine for themselves the most probable interpretation.  \nClosed -loop communication is a technique used to avoid misunderstandings . The sender gives a message, the \nreceiver repeats a received message, or an appropriate part thereof, back to the sender to obtain confirmation of \ncorrect reception.  \nWhen the receiver correctly repeats the message back, the sender will say “YES” (a response in the aff irmative). \nWhen the receiver incorrectly repeats the message back, the sender will say “ NO” (a response in the n egative) and \nrepeat the correct  message. If the sender, the person giving the message, does not get a reply back, the sender \nmust repeat it until the receiver starts closing the loop.  If there is difficulty in confirming reception of a message, \nthe sender may need to consider rephrasing the message.   \nClosed -loop communication should be used to confirm that messages from VTS personnel are correctly  received \nand understood.  This can be achieved through the following steps:  \n• The VTS operator requesting the recipient to repeat back important information ( for example, repeat \nadvice, repeat instruction or repeat back) . \n• The recipient reading back or acknowledging in a manner to clearly indicate they have understood the message and will take appropriate action.  \n• The VTS operator listening to the read -back to ascertain that the message has been correctly \nacknowledged and take immediate action to correct any discrepancies revealed by the read- back.  \nVTS INFORMATION . Berth changed to Elm five, read back over.  \nSHIP  Berth changed to Acorn five, over.  \nVTS NO. Berth changed to Elm five, read back over.  \nSHIP  Berth changed to Elm five, over.  \nVTS YES. Out \n5.3.3.  INFLUENCE  OF INTERNAL  AND  EXTERNAL  FACTORS  \nSome factors such as mental and emotional state, health, culture, working environment, distractions etc. can influence the interpretation of communications. Efforts should be made to minim ize their n egative effects on \ncommunications.  \n  \n \n \n \nIALA Guideline  G1132 VTS Voice Communications and Phraseology   \nEdition 2.2  urn:mrn:iala:pub:g1132:ed2.2  P 20 6. PART C  STANDARD PHRASE S \n \n6.1. OVERVIEW  \n \nThe aim of this part  is to establish globally harmonize d standard phrases for use by a VTS.  VTS personnel should be \nfamiliar with these phrases, which should be remembered for immediate recall. It follows that the number of \nstandard VTS phrases should be limited to those that VTS personnel can reasonably be expected to learn and this \nsection, therefore, restricts the number of standard phrases to those operational circumstances where it is judged \nthat time may be critical or where misunderstandings might compromise safety.  \nMessage markers have intentionally not been included in the standard phras es as the appropriate message marker \nmay differ dependent on the context.  \nThese standard phrases are not intended to replace  or contradict the International R egulations for Preventing \nCollisions at Sea, 1972  or special local rules or recommendations made b y IMO concerning ships' routeing. Neither \nare they intended to supersede the International Code of Signals  [8] nor to replace  normal radiotelephone practice \nas set o ut in the ITU Radio Regulations . They are designed to complement the phrases in SMCP adapting them as \nnecessary to align with current recognize d best practice, recognising that SMCP has not been updated since 2001.  \nThe following typographical conventions are used throughout this part to clearly emphas ize the recommended \nphrases : \n ( ) brackets indicate that the part of the message enclosed within the brackets may be added where \nrelevant;  \n[ ]     square brackets indicate optional content ; \n/ oblique  strokes indicate that the items on either side of the stroke are alternatives; \n... dots indicate that the relevant information is to be filled in where the dots occur;  \n(italic letters) indicate the kind of information requested;  and \n~ tildes precede possible words or phrases which can be used after/in association with the given standard \nphrase.  \n6.2.

INFORMATION  BROADCASTS   \nWhen providing Information, the VTS may direct the message to a particular ship. Alternatively, general information \nmay be to all ships in the area by a routine broadcast message.  This may contain a number of the message elements \nlisted above combining traffic information, weather information and tidal/ hydrographic  information.  A broadcast \nis directed to “All Ships” and this call is normally repeated three times before the message itself is transmitted.  The \nmessage should start with the message marker INFORMATION.   \nBroadcasts may also be used to transmit emergency information in the event of a major marine, e nvironmental, \nsecurity incident or on suspension of any VTS services, advising of any special restricted / safety areas and any communication restrictions or changes.

INTRODUCTION  \n \nTo ensure the harmonized delivery of VTS worldwide p rocesses  and procedures should be implemented in a manner \nthat are consistent with Recommendation R0127  (V-127) VTS Operations  [1] relating to implementing processes \nand procedures  to ensure standards are consistently maintained and the s ervice is delivered accurately . \nFor the purposes of this Guideline:  \n• Process : “is defined as a series of actions or steps taken in order to achieve a particular end.”  \n• Procedure : “is defined as an established or official way of doing something.” \nProcesses and procedures provide the mechanism to:  \n• Ensure tasks are performed correctly and that the provision of VTS is consistent globally;  \n• Ensure conformance with the entity’s policy and regulatory framework;  \n• Provide guidance for decision- making ; and  \n• Streamline internal and external processes.  \nIMO Reso lution A.1158( 32) Guidelines  for Vessel T raffic Services  [2] states that: \na. Vessel traffic services are provided worldwide and make a valuable contribution to safety of \nnavigation, improved efficiency of traffic flow and the protection of the marine environment. \nb. The level of safety and efficiency in the movement of maritime traffic within an area covered \nby vessel traffic services is dependent upon close cooperation between those operating the \nvessel traffic services and participating ships . \nc. The use of differing procedures may cause confusion to ship masters, and that vessel traffic \nservices should be established and operated in a harmonized manner and in accordance with internationally approved guidelines . \n2. PURPOSE OF THE DOCUMENT  \n \nThe purpose of this Guideline is to provide a framework for authorities to implement processes and procedures \nassociated with the provision of VTS.  \n2.1. RELA TIONSHIP TO OTHER DOCUMENTS \n \nIALA Guideline G1141 Operational procedures for Vessel Traffic Services  [3] is associated with Recommendation \nR0127 (V-127)  VTS Operations a normati ve provision of IALA Standard S1040 Vessel Traffic Services (VTS) [4]. To \ndemonstrate compliance with the Recommendation the provisions of this Guideline need to be i mplemented.  \nNote: This Guidance should be read in conjunction with Recommendation R0132 Quality Management for Aids to Navigation Authorities (O- 132)  [5] and Guideline G1052 Quality Management Systems for AtoN Service Delivery  [6], \nnoting that G1052 states that documentation for the Quality Management System (QMS) should include, inter alia:  \n• Procedure documents, e.g. , Operating guidelines, operating procedures, work instructions  \n• Record keeping \n \n \n \n \nIALA Guideline  G1141 Operational Procedures for Delivering VTS  \nEdition 2.2  urn:mrn:iala:pub:g1141:ed2.2  P 6 3. CONTENT  OF THE DOCUMENT  \n \nThe Guideline describes proce sses and  procedures associated with:  \n• Day-to-day operation s to; \n• provide timely and relevant information on factors that may influence the vessel’s movements \nand assist onboard decision- making ; \n• monitor and manage vessel traffic to ensure the safety and efficiency of vessel movements ; and  \n• respond to developing unsafe situations . \n• Management  and administration to ; \n• ensur e the VTS operates in accordance with relevant international conventions and IMO \ninstruments, IALA standard s and national law ; and  \n• set operational objectives for the VTS that are consistent with improving safety and efficiency of \nvessel  traffic and protection of the environment  and routinely evaluating that they are being \nachieved . \nThese processes and procedure s are separated into activities that are either internal or external  to the VTS, and \nsubsequently split into  routine  or emergency : \n• Internal  Procedures  – procedures  that cover  the day-to-day running of a VTS,  including but not limited \nto the operation  of syste ms and sensors, i nteractions  among the staff and  the internal manag ement  etc. \n• External  Procedures  – procedures  that cover the interacti on with  participating  ships and  allied  services.  \n4. INTERNAL VTS PROCEDURES  \n \nVTS authorities should implement processes and procedures for all internal activities related to the VTS. A clear \ndistinction should be made between  routine and emergency activities as described below.  \nRecognizing that activities may vary between VTS , these may be further adapted to suit local needs . \n4.1. ROUTINE PROCEDURES  \n \n4.1.1.  DOCUMENT CONTROL  \nProcesses and procedures  should be  documented , regularly  reviewed  and version control maintained. These \ndocuments should be availa ble to VTS personnel  and form an integral  part of training  where adherence  is routinely \nmonitored .  \nFurther, t o achieve collaboration, it is recommended that these procedures (or part of them) may be shared with \nallied services .  \n4.1.2.  GATHERING AND RECORDING OF INFORMATIO N \nProvision should be  made for the storage, security, retrieval and presenta tion of this information . This type  of \ninformation  may  include:  \n• Communications  (inter nal and/or  external)  \n• Sensor  data  (i.e., data  used  to generate the traffic  image  such  as radar,  CCTV,  AIS) \n \n \n \nIALA Guideline  G1141 Operational Procedures for Delivering VTS  \nEdition 2.2  urn:mrn:iala:pub:g1141:ed2.2  P 7 • Vessel  data and voyage  information  (e.g., vessel particulars,  cargo data,  including vessel  movem ent \ninformation)  \n• Meteorological  and hydro graphic  data \n• Data from  other sources \nThe internal procedures should specify the time period for which VTS information is stored.  This time  period  should  \nbe such  that it allows for the full retrieval of data  post -incident/acci dent, in compliance  with  national  \nrequirements  and those  of the  incident /accident  investigation  procedures  of the VTS provider  and other  interested  \nparties.  \n4.1.3.  EQUIPMENT OPERATION , MAINTENANCE , CALIBRATION AND UPDATING  \nAll manuals  and handbooks  for equipment  operation,  maintenance  (preventative and remedial), calibration and  \nupdating should  be properly  maintained and  readily  available  to the appropriate  personnel.  \nKey considerations  include: \n• Descriptions of equipment and systems used in the VTS  \n• Operation  of equipment,  to cover  all normal  and emergency  procedures  \n• Determin ing performance availability  criteria for equipment , including the availability of VTS during \nmaintenance or other outages  \n• Categoriz ation  and prioritiz ation  of maintenance  and defects  \n• Calibration  of sensors within  specified  toler ance level  \n• Updat es to  equipment  (hardware  and software)  and their  associa ted manuals/handbooks  \n• VTS availability due to maintenance or other outages . \n4.1.4.  PUBLIC RELATIONS  \nThere should  be a documented  processes and procedures to deal with  media  and public  relations issues. Issues for \nconsiderati on may  include:  \n• Nominated  lead  department  for public  relations  \n• Publication of ongoing activities within the VTS area  \n• Protection  of sensitive  information  \n4.1.5.  SECURITY  \nProcesses and p rocedures  should  be clearly documented and consistent with  local and national  requirements.

ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION  \nThe role of VTS to assist with environmental protection may include marine conservation measures is increasingly \nbeing recognized internationally as a means to:  \n• mitigate risks such as ship collisions with cetaceans  and disturbance of marine mammals in nursery \nareas;  \n• mitigate the effect of ship wash on the shore s in the vi cinity of low-lying  communities; and  \n• support the protection of Particularly Sensitive Sea Areas (PSSAs)  or locally declared environmentally \nsensitive areas.  \nIt may be appropriate to develop processes and procedures to:  \n• broadcast relevant inf ormation on time s and locations;  \n• interact with individual vessel s in the vicinity of marine mammals;  \n• keep p rotected areas clear of traffic;  \n• advise speed restrictions where marine mammals have been sighted, or t o reduce ship wash on the \nshore s; \n• re-route traffic away from s ightings; and  \n• collect information to identify potential interaction hotspots to assist in planning future mitigation \nmeasures . \n \n \n \nIALA Guideline  G1141 Operational Procedures for Delivering VTS  \nEdition 2.2  urn:mrn:iala:pub:g1141:ed2.2  P 15 5.1.14.  DIGITAL MARITIME SERVICES  \nWhere the VTS provides information in digital format, p rocesses and procedures on digital information exchange \nshould be established. This information may include , for example, the use of AIS messages to provide informatio n \non weather , virtual AtoN  or the exchange of route information  between vessels and VTS . \nThe procedures should  include a description  of the digital information delivered and the communication means \nused for the information exchange.  \n5.1.15.  INTERACTION WITH ALLIED SERVICES  \nProcesses and p rocedures should be established to cover the interaction  between VTS and  allied services , for example:  \n• Pilots  \n• Tugs and tug operators  \n• Icebreakers and icebreaker operators  \n• The organizers of marine events  \n• Shipping ag ents  \n• Gover nment  agencies,  including law enforcement  agencies  \nPlease note, IALA Guideline G1102 VTS Interaction with Allied or Other Services  [16] identifies issues to be \nconsidered and the principles to successfully interact between VTS and allied or other services.  \n5.2. EMERGENCY PROCEDURES  \n \nThe activities  of the VTS centre  should be maintained  during any emerg ency response. \nOther authorities  (e.g., Maritime  Rescue  Co-ordination  Centre  (MRCC))  might  be resp onsible  for handling  external \nemergencies  within the VTS area. In  that case , proced ures on  the interaction between  the VTS and these  authorities  \nneed  to be establish ed. \nI\nncidental co -o\nperation with emergency services, such as Search and Rescue and Pollution Control may be \nconducted in accordance with pre -e\nstablished contingency plans in which the procedures for interaction with allied \nor other services are laid down and responsibilities established.  \nDes\npite this, t he VTS may be one  of the first to respond to a call from a vessel that has an emergency situation.  It is \nimportant that VTS requests and collects any further informatio n to help in response activities and to pass on to \nother authorities.  Some considerations for information that a VTS may  try to establish from the vessel under these \nsituations can be found in a nnex B.  \n5.2.1.  COLLISION , CAPSIZING , SINKING , GROUNDING , FIRE ONBOARD , MAN OVERBOARD  \nProcesses and p rocedures  should be establish ed to deal  with  situation s such  as collision,  capsiz ing, sinking, \ngrounding,  fire onboard  and man  over board .

BACKGROUND \n \nAn artificial Intelligence (AI) system is a machine-based system that can, for a given set of defined objectives, make \npredictions, recommendations, or decisions. AI systems offer functionality needed to operate with varying levels of \nautonomy [1].  \nDeep learning, machine learning and AI are all related to each other. The learning methods make use of large \namounts of data. This results in a performance that often cannot be achieved using classical discrete algorithms. \nThe amount of data needed leads to questions related to data privacy.  \nThere are concerns that need to be considered by regulators, providers, and users of maritime centric artificial \nintelligence systems. These are often addressed by policy or guidelines that are organization centric. This Guideline \nis a living document and seeks to provide guidance in consideration of AI within the IALA domain. \n1.1. OBJECTIVE \n \nUnderstand the advantages and risks of AI within the IALA domain and how to manage this risk now, and provide \nguidance going forwards, recognizing the rapid growth of AI and its capabilities. \n1.2. SCOPE \n \n The following topics are in scope of this document: \n applications used in maritime environment for AtoN and VTS (within the IALA mandate); and \n AI with Machine Learning (ML) and deep learning. \nThe evaluation and recommendation of commercial AI and ML solutions are out of scope. \n2. OVERVIEW  \n \nThe relationship between deep learning, neural networks, ML and AI is often diagrammatically explained as \nprovided in Figure 1. This is based on the Organisation for Economic Co-operarion and Development (OECD) AI \nPrinciples [2] and often termed “AI subsets”.  \nOften significant volumes of data are required to train the AI models to enable the required outcomes to be \nachieved for example, many pictures of person's faces are required to enable an AI model that can deal accurately \nwith facial recognition. \n  \n \n \n \nIALA Guideline G1178 An Introduction to Artificial Intelligence (AI) from an IALA perspective  \nEdition 1.0 urn:mrn:iala:pub:g1178:ed1.0 P 5  \nFigure 1  Overview of AI and subsets (adapted from OECD [2]) \nThe concerns that surround AI systems are: \n1. Bias (e.g., commercial, cultural and gender); \n2. Accuracy (e.g., AI versus deterministic systems); \n3. Transparency (e.g., when investigating an incident, how is IALA to deal with AI decision support tools); \n4. State of the AI system when a decision is made;  \n5. Conflict between different AI systems in the same domain;  \n6. The patenting of AI systems;  \n7. The commercial value of working and tested AI systems; and \n8. Data privacy issues. \n2.1. BIAS \n \nBias includes potential cultural, gender, race, and commercial biases. Aspects of bias will reflect the data used for \ntraining. \nFor example, these biases may become apparent when AI is used to detect which VTS operator is at a specified \noperating position, the operator’s attentiveness, and activity over the period of a shift.  \n2.2. ACCURACY  \n \nAccuracy of AI is identified through a confidence score. A confidence score is a number between 0 and 1 that \nrepresents the likelihood that the output of a machine learning model is correct and will satisfy a user’s request, \nwhere 1 represent a 100% accuracy.  \nAs an example, using Microsoft’s breakdown of confidence score’s meaning for an interactive voice response \nsystem can be categorized as follows: \nDeep Learning  \nSoftware trained by using \nMultilayer Neural Networks \nand data \nMachine Learning  \nSubset of AI that uses \nstatistical techniques \nenabling the machine to \nimprove with experience \nArtificial Intelligence  \nTechniques that enable \nmachines to mimic human \nintelligence using a variety \nof methods implemented in \nsoftware \n \n \n \nIALA Guideline G1178 An Introduction to Artificial Intelligence (AI) from an IALA perspective  \nEdition 1.0 urn:mrn:iala:pub:g1178:ed1.0 P 6  Over 0.7: the prediction is a strong candidate for answering the user query. \n Between 0.3 and 0.7: the prediction can partially answer the request. \n Below 0.3: the prediction is probably not a good choice. \nIn practical applications, confidence values close to 1 are required in safety critical systems. The new methods \nused in AI and ML require new approaches to test and evaluate the confidence in, and accuracy of, AI based \nsystems. This means that new approaches are required for audit and certification of AI systems.  \n2.3. TRANSPARENCY \n \nIALA has traditionally used systems that are deterministic. This means that the systems are rules based and, for the \nsame inputs, the same output is guaranteed. Users should be sure of the same result when AI systems are used. \nTransparency is required when decisions are made in an AI system where the user has no insight as to how the \ndecision was made. \nAI methods are combined statistical methods. The decisions made by AI are usually not explainable. The statistical \napproach implemented in the AI, and the data used for training in the AI system, should be declared and the \napproach should be able to be explained. \n2.4. STATE OF AI WHEN A DECISION IS MADE  \n \nThe accuracy of an AI system relies on the implementation of a statistical approach. In addition, the accuracy is \nbased on the quantity and quality of the data used in training and any new data that has been processed. The state \nof the AI when a decision is made should be auditable (see APPENDIX 1).  \n2.5. CONFLICT OF SYSTEMS IN THE SAME DOMAIN \n \nEach AI system relies on the implementation of different AI statistical approaches. They can also use different \ntraining data, with access to different sensors and live data streams, working to deliver similar outputs.  \nFor example, ship route optimization will use several different data sources, including port of departure, type of \nship and weather forecasts along the route. This will allow an optimized route to be provided. Different route \noptimization companies use different AI approaches, which may provide different routes. \n2.6. PATENTS \n \nThis refers to the need to declare the patent status of various systems used in the IALA domain, which should \ninclude declaration of AI systems used. This may include a subset of a patent, or different providers may refer to \nthe same AI patent.  \n2.7. COMMERCIAL VALUE \n \nThis refers to the commercial value of AI systems. The value of some AI systems can be very high and the protection \nof these, as well as the associated training data, needs to be considered. \n \n \n \n \nIALA Guideline G1178 An Introduction to Artificial Intelligence (AI) from an IALA perspective  \nEdition 1.0 urn:mrn:iala:pub:g1178:ed1.0 P 7 3. BENEFITS AND CHALLENGES OF AI WITHIN THE IALA CONTEXT  \n \nThere are identified benefits and challenges with the use of AI. These have been adapted to the IALA context and \ninclude those identified in Table 1.  \nTable 1   Examples and Challenges of AI in the IALA Context \nExamples Challenges \n Ensuring VTS operator focus \n Approach and departure management \n AtoN system availability management for both \nmaintenance and service availability \n Use of AI in Radar target extraction \n AI to detect ships using CCTV cameras \n VTS situational awareness  Applicable data \n Transformation of processes \n AI training processes \n Gathering the data for the data model \n Audit regime for AI \n \n4. AUDIT REGIME FOR AI  \n \nAs AI becomes integrated into systems and processes, it is important that they are subject to a comprehensive \nauditing regime. The primary aspects of the audit will include compliance (assessing the risk related to the use of \nthe AI and compliance with standards) and technology (assessing the risk related to the AI itself, privacy and security \nof data). AI should be implemented in a manner that supports an audit regime.  \nA proposed approach for an auditing regime of AI is provided in APPENDIX 1. This will need to be adapted and \nexpanded further within the IALA context as experience is gained in the implementation of AI in the IALA context. \n5. CONCLUSION \n \nAs AI grows in usage in the maritime domain, IALA has a responsibility to consider how the use of this technology \ncan assist and affect the IALA members. Some guiding principles include: \n1. AI systems should make sure that AI-driven decisions are fair and free of any harmful bias and endeavour \nto develop AI in an ethical way so that it can be trusted. This should also ensure that outputs from these \ndata-driven systems support effective decision making and do not guide users to make decisions that may \naffect any group or individual in an unfair way.  \n2. AI systems should promote transparency and accountability. AI systems should inform users when they \ncommunicate directly with AI-powered systems and/or are subject to outcomes in which AI system have \nplayed a role.  \n3. Designers and providers of AI systems should endeavour to respect the privacy and protect the security of \nall individuals served by the AI systems deployed. \n4. AI systems should be designed and deployed in a manner that fosters diversity, accessibility, and inclusivity. \n5. AI systems should be designed and deployed in a manner that supports investigations of incidents by using \naudit mechanisms during design, development, deployment, and operation. \n \n \n \n \nIALA Guideline G1178 An Introduction to Artificial Intelligence (AI) from an IALA perspective  \nEdition 1.0 urn:mrn:iala:pub:g1178:ed1.0 P 8 6. DEFINITIONS \n \nThe definitions of terms used in this Guideline can be found in the International Dictionary of Marine Aids to \nNavigation  (IALA dictionary)and were checked as correct at the timeof going to print. Where conflict arises, the \nIALA Dictionary should be considered as the authoritative source of definitions used in IALA documents. \nAdditional definitions specific to this document are:  \nArtificial intelligence An artificial intelligence (AI) system is a machine-based system that can, for a given set of \nhuman-defined objectives, make predictions, recommendations, or decisions influencing \nreal or virtual environments. AI systems are designed to operate with varying levels of \nautonomy. \nMachine learning Machine learning (ML) is the use and development of computer systems that are able to \nlearn and adapt without following explicit instructions by using algorithms and statistical \nmodels to analyse and draw inferences from patterns in data. \nDeep learning Deep learning is a type of machine learning based on artificial neural networks in which \nmultiple layers of processing are used to extract progressively higher-level features from \ndata. \n7.

SCOPING STAGE \nThis is the stage in which the risk analysis begins by mapping out intended use cases and identifying analogous \ndeployments either within the organization or from competitors or adjacent industries. The goal is to anticipate \nareas to investigate as potential sources of harm and social impact. At this stage, interaction with the system should \nbe minimal. \n1.2. MAPPING STAGE \nThis is a review of what is already in place and the perspectives involved in the audited system. This is also the time \nto map internal stakeholders, identify key collaborators for the execution of the audit, and orchestrate the \nappropriate stakeholder buy-in required for execution. \n1.3. ARTEFACT COLLECTION STAGE \nThis stage requires the identification and collection all the required documentation from the product development \nprocess, to prioritize opportunities for testing and can include other product development artifacts such as design \ndocuments and reviews, in addition to systems architecture diagrams and other implementation planning \ndocuments and retrospectives. \n1.4. TESTING STAGE \nThis stage is when the auditors execute a series of tests to gauge the compliance of the system with the prioritized \nethical values of the organization. Auditors engage with the system in various ways and produce a series of artifacts \nto demonstrate the performance of the analysed system at the time of the audit. Additionally, auditors review the \ndocumentation collected from the previous stage and begin to make assessments of the likelihood of system \nfailures to comply with declared principles. \n1.5. REFLECTION STAGE \nThis phase of the audit is the more reflective stage, when the results of the tests at the execution stage are analysed \nin juxtaposition with the ethical expectations clarified in the audit scoping. This phase will reflect on product \ndecisions and design recommendations that could be made following the audit results. \n \n \n \n1 https://doi.org/10.1145/3351095.3372873"

This is of particular importance in the light of \nthe increasing number of internationally trading vessels with crews speaking many different \nlanguages, since problems of communicati on may cause misunderstandings leading to dangers to \nthe vessel, the people on board and the environment. \n \nIn 1973, the Maritime Safety Committee agreed, at its twenty -seventh session that where \nlanguage difficulties arise a common language should be used for navigational purposes, and that \nlanguage should be English. In consequence the Standard Marine Navigational Vocabulary \n(SMNV) was developed, adopted in 1977 and amended in 1985. \n \nIn 1992, the Maritime Safety Committee, at its sixtieth session, instruct ed the Sub -Committee \non Safety of Navigation to develop a more comprehensive standardized safety language than \nSMNV 1985, taking into account the changing conditions in modern seafaring and covering all \nmajor safety -related verbal communications. \n \nAt its s ixty-eighth session in 1997, the Maritime Safety Committee adopted the Draft IMO \nStandard Marine Communication Phrases (SMCP) developed by the Sub -Committee on Safety of \nNavigation.  The draft IMO SMCP, following international trials, was amended at the fo rty-sixth \nsession of this Sub -Committee, and was given final consideration by the Maritime Safety \nCommittee at its seventy -fourth session in the light of remarks received by the Organization.  The \nIMO SMCP was adopted by the Assembly in November 2001 as resolution  A.918(22). \n \nUnder the International Convention on Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping \nfor Seafarers, 1978, as revised 1995, the ability to use and understand the IMO SMCP is required \nfor the certification of officers in charge of  a navigational watch on ships of 500 gross tonnage or \nmore. \n \n \nResolution A.918(22) \nAdopted on 29 November 2001  (Agenda item 9) \nIMO STANDARD MARINE COMMUNICATION PHRASES\nA 22/Res.918  -

Furthermore, the IMO SMCP, as a collection of \nindividual phrases, should not be regarded as any kind of technical manual providing operational \ninstructions. \n \nThe IMO SMCP meets the requirements of the STCW Convention, 1978, as revised, and of the \nSOLAS Convention, 1974, as revised, regarding verbal communications; moreover, the phrases cover \nthe relevant communication safety aspects laid down in these Conventions.  \n \nUse of the IMO SMCP should be made as often as possible in preference to other wording of similar \nmeaning; as a minimum requirement, users should adhere as closely as possi ble to them in relevant \nsituations. In this way they are intended to become an acceptable safety language, using English for \nthe verbal interchange of intelligence among individuals of all maritime nations on the many and \nvaried occasions when precise mean ings and translations are in doubt, as is increasingly evident \nunder modern conditions at sea. \n \nThe accompanying CD/Cassette is designed to familiarize users with the pronunciation of the \nphrases. \n \n2 Organization of the IMO SMCP \n \nThe IMO SMCP is divided in to External Communication Phrases and On -board Communication \nPhrases as far as its application is concerned, and into Part A and Part B as to its status within the \nframework of STCW 1978 as revised.  \n \nPart A covers phrases applicable in external communicati ons, and may be regarded as the \nreplacement of the Standard Marine Navigational Vocabulary 1985, which is required to be used and \nunderstood under the STCW Code, 1995, Table A -II/I.  This part is enriched by essential phrases \nconcerning ship handling and s afety of navigation to be used in on- board communications, \nparticularly when the Pilot is on the bridge, as required by Regulation 14(4), Chapter V, \nSOLAS  1974, as revised.  \n \nPart B calls attention to other on- board standard safety-related phrases which, supplementary to \nPart A may also be regarded as useful for maritime English instruction.  \n \nResolution A.918(22) \nAdopted on 29 November 2001  (Agenda item 9) \nIMO STANDARD MARINE COMMUNICATION PHRASES\nA 22/Res.918  - 12 - \n \n \nI:\\ASSEMBLY\\22 \\RES\\918.doc 3 Position of the IMO SMCP in Maritime Education and Training  \n \nThe IMO SMCP is not intended to provide a comprehensive maritime English syllabus, which is \nexpected to cover a far wider range of language skills to be achieved in the fields of vocabulary, \ngrammar, discourse abilities, etc., than the IMO SMCP could ever manage.  However, Part A in \nparticular should be an indispensable part of any curriculum which is designed to meet the \ncorresponding requirements of the STCW Convention 1978 as revised.  In addition, Part B offers \na rich choice of situations covered by phrases well suited to meet the communication \nrequirements of the STCW Convention 1978 as revised, which mariners are implicitly expected \nto satisfy.  \n \nThe IMO SMCP should be taught and learned selectively according to users’ specific needs, \nrather than in its entirety.  The respective instruction should be based on practice in the maritime \nenvironment, and shou ld be implemented through appropriate modern language teaching \nmethods. \n \n4 Basic communicative features \n \nThe IMO SMCP builds on a basic knowledge of the English language.  It was drafted \nintentionally in a simplified version of maritime English in order to reduce grammatical, lexical \nand idiomatic varieties to a tolerable minimum, using standardized structures for the sake of its \nfunction aspects, i.e. reducing misunderstanding in safety -related verbal communications, \nthereby endeavouring to reflect present  maritime English language usage on board vessels and in \nship- to-shore/ship- to-ship communications.  \n \nThis means that in phrases offered for use in emergency and other situations developing under \nconsiderable pressure of time or psychological stress, as well as in navigational warnings, a block \nlanguage is applied which uses sparingly or omits the function words the, a/an, is/are,  as done in \nseafaring practice. Users, however, may be flexible in this respect.  \n \nFurther communicative features may be summarized as follows:  \n- avoiding synonyms \n- avoiding contracted forms \n- providing fully worded answers to \"yes/no\" -questions and basic alternative \nanswers to sentence questions \n- providing one phrase for one event, and  \n- structuring the corresponding phrases according to t he principle: identical \ninvariable plus variable. \n \n5 Typographical conventions  \n \n ( )  brackets  indicate that the part of the message enclosed within the brackets \nmay be added where relevant; \n /  oblique strokes indicate that the items on either side of the stroke are \nalternatives; \n ...  dots indicate that the relevant information is to be filled in where the dots \noccur; \n \n(italic letters)  indicate the kind of information requested; \n \n ~  tildes precede possible words or phrases which can be used after/in \nassociation with the given standard phrase. \n \nResolution A.918(22) \nAdopted on 29 November 2001  (Agenda item 9) \nIMO STANDARD MARINE COMMUNICATION PHRASES\n - 13 - A 22/Res.918 \n \n \nI:\\ASSEMBLY\\22 \\RES\\918.doc GENERAL  \n \n1 Procedure  \n \nWhen it is necessary to indicate that the IMO SMCP are to be used, the following \nmessage may be sent:  \n \n\"Please use IMO Standard Marine Communication Phrases.\"  \n \n\"I will use IMO Standard Marine Communication Phrases.\"  \n \n2 Spelling  \n \n2.1 Spelling of letters \n \nWhen spelling is necessary, only the following spelling table should be used:  \n \nLetter  Code  Letter  Code                 \n     A Alfa      N Novem ber      \n     B Bravo       O Oscar \n     C Char lie      P Papa \n     D      Delta        Q Quebec \n     E Echo      R Romeo \n     F Foxtrot      S      Sierra \n     G  Golf      T     Tango \n     H      Hotel       U Uniform  \n     I India      V Victor \n     J Juliet      W Whis ky \n     K Kilo      X  X-ray \n     L Lima      Y Yankee \n     M  Mike       Z Zulu \n \n2.2  Spelling of digits and numbers  \n \nA few digits and numbers have a modified  pronunciation compared to general English:  \n \nNumber  Spelling  Pronunciation  \n0 zero ZEERO \n1 one WUN  \n2 two TOO \n3 three TREE  \n4 four FOW ER \n5 five FIFE \n6 six SIX \n7 seven  SEVEN \n8 eight  AIT \n9 nine NINER \n1000  thousand TOU SAND \nResolution A.918(22) \nAdopted on 29 November 2001  (Agenda item 9) \nIMO STANDARD MARINE COMMUNICATION PHRASES\nA 22/Res.918  - 14 - \n \n \nI:\\ASSEMBLY\\22 \\RES\\918.doc 3 Message Markers  \n \nIn shore- to-ship and ship- to-shore communication or radio communication in general, the \nfollowing eight Message Markers may be used (also see \" Application of Message \nMarkers \" given in PART A1/6  \"Vessel Traffic Service (VTS) Standard Phrases\"):  \n \n(i) Instruction  \n(ii) Advice  \n(iii) Warning  \n(iv) Information  \n(v) Question  \n(vi) Answer  \n(vii) Request  \n(viii)  Intention  \n \n4 Responses  \n \n4.1 When the answer to a question is in the affirmative, say: \n\"Yes .... \"  followed by the appropriate phrase in full. \n \n4.2 When the answer to a question is in the negative, say: \n\"No ...\" followed by the appropriate phrase in full. \n \n4.3 When the information requested is not immediately available, say:  \n\"Stand by\" followed by the time interval within which the information will be  \navailable. \n \n4.4 When the information requested cannot be obtained, say:  \n\"No information.\"  \n \n4.5 When an INSTRUCTION (e.g. by a VTS Station, n aval vessel or other fully authorized \npersonnel ) or an ADVICE is given, respond if in the affirmative:  \n\"I will/can ... \" - followed by the instruction or advice in full; and, \nif in the negative, respond:  \n\"I will not/cannot ... \" - followed by the instruction or advice in full. \n \nExample: \"ADVICE.

Mariners’ attention  is drawn to the very important Rule 7(a) which states that “every vessel shall \nuse all available means appropriate to the prevailing cir-\ncumstances and conditions to determine if risk of collision exists”.  In doing so, they are to take note of the follow-\ning concerning VHF and AIS.Collision PreventionPrecautions When Using \nVHF and AIS\nPRECAUTIONS WHEN USING VHF AND AIS\nVHF\nMany investigations worldwide have revealed that VHF com -\nmunication is one of the contributing factors in collisions at \nsea. \nIn many of the so called “VHF assisted” collisions, the “VHF \ncommunication” between  ships had created misunderstand -\nings leading to close quarter situations or collisions. \nMariners are reminded that compliance with COLREGs is a \nmuch more effective way to avert a collision than the use of VHF communications.\nReference: IMO Resolution A.954(23) AIS\nAIS information may be used to assist in collision avoidance \ndecision making, bearing in mind two cautionary points:\n• AIS is an additional source of navigational information. It \ndoes not replace, but supports, navigational systems such as radar target-tracking and VTS \n• The use of AIS does not negate the responsibilities of the mariners to comply at all times with COLREGs.\nIn addition, mariners are to take note that not all ships are fitted with AIS.  Also at times, AIS may be switched off or \nthe information provided by AIS may be incomplete or incor\n-\nrect.  \nReference: IMO Resolution A.917 (22), Resolution A.956 (23)\n\nSAFE PASSAGE \nTHE STRAITS OF MALACCA AND SINGAPORESAFE PASSAGE \nTHE STRAITS OF MALACCA AND SINGAPORE\n8\n9The Rules have been established for vessels navigating \nthrough the SOMS.  \nMariners must comply with the rules concerning:• Deep draft vessels and VLCCs navigating  within the \nTSS \n• Vessels having defects affecting operational safety \n• Action to be taken in an emergency or breakdown of \na vessel in the traffic lane \n• Radio broadcast on movements of vessels  constrained by their draught \n• Safe speed \n• Participating in ship reporting system\nReference: IMO Ships’ Routeing, Part FRouteing MeasuresRules for vessels navigating through \nthe Straits of Malacca and Singapore\nTraffic Separation Scheme\nThe IMO-adopted Traffic Separation Scheme (TSS) was \nestablished in the SOMS between Permatang Sedepa (One \nFathom Bank) and the entrance to the South China Sea in \nthe vicinity of Horsburgh Lighthouse, a total distance of 250 nm.  Designated routes for deep-draught vessels and \nPrecautionary Areas are laid down on the charts. \nReference: IMO Ships’ Routeing, Part B Section V\nNight Signals for Vessels Crossing the TSS in the Singapore \nStrait\nVessels crossing the TSS and Precautionary areas in the Singapore Strait are recommended to display the night sig\n-\nnals consisting of 3 all-round green lights in a vertical line.\nDisplaying the night signals shall not exempt the crossing ves -\nsel of its obligation to give way to other vessels in a crossing \nsituation or any other rules under the COLREGs \nReference: IMO SN.1/Circ. 317\n\nSAFE PASSAGE \nTHE STRAITS OF MALACCA AND SINGAPORESAFE PASSAGE \nTHE STRAITS OF MALACCA AND SINGAPORE\n10\n11STRAITREP\nThe IMO-adopted Mandatory Ship Reporting System known \nas STRAITREP has been established in the SOMS to enhance \nnavigational safety and to protect the marine environment. \nIn general, all passenger vessels, vessels carrying hazardous cargo, vessels of 300 gross tonnage and above and all vessels \nof 50 metres and above are required to participate in the ship \nreporting system.\nParticipating in STRAITREP \nThe operational area of the STRAITREP is divided into 9 sec -\ntors with each sector operating on a different VHF channel.\nVessel Traffic Service\nThe VTS Authorities provide the following services to vessels \nparticipating in the STRAITREP. \nInformation Service  (e.g. information on Deep Draft Vessel & \nVLCC transiting through the Deep Water Route) \nNavigational Assistance (e.g. advice to individual vessels on \npotential close quarter situation)\nNavigational broadcast (e.g. information on unlit or dam -\naged buoys/beacons)Meteorological Information (e.g.  warnings on haze, adverse \nweather conditions)STRAITREP\nSector 1 – VHF Channel 66\nSector 2 – VHF Channel 88Sector 3 – VHF Channel 84Sector 4 – VHF Channel 61Sector 5 – VHF Channel 88Sector 6 – VHF Channel 88Sector 7 – VHF Channel 73Sector 8 – VHF Channel 14Sector 9 – VHF Channel 10The VTS authorities for the STRAITREP are as follows:\nSector 1 to Sector 5 - Klang VTS\nSector 6            - Johor VTS\nSector 7 to Sector 9 - Singapore VTSIn addition, the Singapore VTS provides vessels with informa -\ntion on traffic situation at the Pilot Boarding Grounds at the \nPort of Singapore so as to assist Mariners navigate safely to \nembark their pilots.\nA master who provides or receives information with \nSTRAITREP is not relieved from any of his duties and respon -\nsibilities as a master.\nReference: IMO Ships’ Routeing, Part G Section I/14\n\nSAFE PASSAGE \nTHE STRAITS OF MALACCA AND SINGAPORESAFE PASSAGE \nTHE STRAITS OF MALACCA AND SINGAPORE\n12\n13Anchoring\nThere has been a proliferation of vessels anchoring within \nthe TSS and Precautionary Areas in the SOMS as well as \nbetween the landward limits of the TSS and approaches to \nthe ports.  These vessels pose a risk to the safety of navigation by obstructing traffic flow and port approaches.  Mariners \nare advised of the following concerning anchoring in the \nSOMS:\nNo Anchoring\nMariners are therefore reminded not to anchor in any areas in the TSS of the SOMS (Ref.: Rule 10 (g) of COLREGs); as well \nas between landward limits of the TSS and approaches to the \nport. Vessels entering any port in any of the littoral States shall anchor in the anchorages designated by the respective \nlittoral States. \nThe Maritime Authorities of Indonesia, Malaysia and \nSingapore closely monitor the identities and locations of ves\n-\nsels that are anchoring indiscriminately. The relevant author -\nity will take appropriate action including reporting to the \nFlag State of the vessel.\nEmergencies \nIn exceptional circumstances such as an emergency where anchoring cannot be avoided, shipmasters are  advised to \ncarefully ascertain the location of pipelines, submerged \ninstallations and submarine cables  from nautical charts and publications to avoid anchoring over these objects.\nReference: IMO SN.1/Circ. 282Visibility in the SOMS could be restricted due to the follow\n-\ning conditions \nHaze\nSOMS has been affected by severe smoke haze periodically \ndue to forest fires in the region. The haze can be made worse \nby the dry seasons, change in wind directions and precipita -\ntion, especially during the Southwest Monsoon Season which \ncauses the visibility to be severely restricted.  \nLocal weather\nSudden thunderstorms with heavy rain may occur during the monsoon periods between June and August and between \nOctober to December and cause the visibility to be severely \nrestricted. \nDuring periods of restricted visibility, shipmasters are advised \nto keep a proper lookout and navigate with caution. Ships shall comply with the COLREGs and in particular, Rule 19, \nRule 20 and Rule 35 concerning conduct of vessels in restrict\n-\ned visibility, exhibition of navigation lights and sound signals \nin restricted visibility, respectively.Visibility\n\nSAFE PASSAGE \nTHE STRAITS OF MALACCA AND SINGAPORESAFE PASSAGE \nTHE STRAITS OF MALACCA AND SINGAPORE\n14\n15Local Traffic \nConsiderations\nWhen navigating in the SOMS, shipmasters will encounter \nthe following local traffic conditions and are advised to keep \na proper lookout and navigate with caution:\nTugs and Barges\nThere are numerous tugs and barges which travel at low \nspeed in the SOMS. In the Singapore Strait, they are usually \nobserved in the vicinity of Batu Berhanti in the morning cross -\ning the TSS bound for the Port of Singapore.\nCrossing Traffic\nVessels transiting the SOMS may encounter crossing traffic, \nparticularly in these areas:\nThere are frequent ferries crossing the SOMS in the follow -\ning areas:• Approaches to Port Dickson Harbour Limit\n• Approaches to Melaka Harbour Limit\n• Approaches to Muar Harbour Limit\n• Approaches to Batu Pahat Harbour Limit\n• Between Kukup and Pulau Karimun\n• Main Straits \n \n(01 11’.6 N , 103 51’.7E )\n• Approaches to Sisters’ Fairway  \n(01 12’.8 N , 103 50’.7E )\n• Approaches of East Keppel Fairway  \n(01 13’.1N, 103 52’.9E)\n• Approaches to Tanah Merah Ferry Terminal  \n(01 15’.3N , 103 59’.1E  & 01 17’.0N 103 58’.8E)\n• Between Tanah Merah Ferry Terminal and Pulau Bintan  \n(01 15’.5N , 104 05’.1E)Local Traffic \nConsiderations\nCrossing Traffic is also expected to be encountered at the fol -\nlowing precautionary areas:\n• Off Sultan Shoal Lighthouse   \n(103 26’.7E to 103 36’.1E)\n• Off Pulau Sebarok/Belakang Padang  \n(103 49’.1E to 103 50’.7E) \n• Off St John’s Island/Pulau Sambu  \n(103 52’.2E to 103 54’.3E) \n• Off Tanjong Septapa/Pulau Bintan  \n(104 03’.2E to 104 14’.9E)\n• Off Tanjung Ru/Port Klang Harbour Limit\n• Off Port Dickson/Port Dickson Harbour Limit\n• Off Tanjung Keling/Sungai Udang Harbour Limit\n• Off Tanjung Piai/Johor Bahru Harbour Limit\nVessels in the westbound lane near the vicinity of Singapore \nPilot Eastern Boarding Ground “A” (01 13’.5N, 103 53’.4E \nand Pilot Eastern Boarding Ground “B” (01 15’.6N, 103 57’4E) \nmay encounter vessels from the eastbound lane crossing the westbound lane to head for these pilot boarding grounds. \nVLCCs in the deep water route bound for the Shell SBM in the \nPort of Singapore cross the TSS in the vicinity south-east of \nthe Raffles Lighthouse ( 01 09’.6N , 103 44’.5E ).\nFishing Boats\nPoorly lit small fishing boats may be encountered in the \nSOMS. This is particularly true in the western part of the \nSingapore Strait. Mariners are reminded that often small fish -\ning boats do not follow COLREGs.\nBIMCO\nBagsvaerdvej 161\n2880 Bagsvaerd\nDenmark\nfrontoffice@bimco.org\nwww.bimco.orgIn September 2007, under the International Maritime Organization (IMO)’s \n“Protection of Vital Shipping Lanes” initiative, the maritime authorities of \nIndonesia, Malaysia and Singapore established a historic agreement to suc -\ncessfully launch a Co-operative Mechanism (CM) for the Straits of Malacca \nand Singapore (SOMS). The mechanism is a ground-breaking initiative in international co-operation.\nThe CM is the key platform in the SOMS for the littoral States, user states, \nstakeholders and the industries to dialogue, exchange information and share \ntheir valuable perspectives on important SOMS safety and environmental \nissues. \nSince 2007, the CM has overseen many projects aimed at achieving these \ngoals, gathering the views and expertise of the three littoral states working \nclosely with all stakeholders.\nThe promotion of safety of navigation and the protection of the marine \nenvironment dominate the work of the CM. \nOne concrete demonstration of co-operation and burden sharing is the num\n-\nber of projects which have been jointly initiated. These involve everything \nfrom wreck removal to the maintenance of aids to navigation.\nwww.cooperativemechanism.org.my\nBIMCO – An ocean of expertise...\nBIMCO is the oldest of the international shipping associations, comprising a membership of a broad \nrange of stakeholders with vested interests in the shipping industry, including ship-owners, manag -\ners, brokers and agents. The shipowner segment alone operates about 65 per cent of the world’s merchant fleet measured in deadweight tonnage. The association’s main objective is to facilitate \nthe commercial operations of its global membership through the provision of quality informa\n-\ntion and advice, education and training. While promoting fair business practices and developing \nstandards for contract terms, BIMCO is a strong advocate for harmonisation and standardization \nof all shipping related activity, whether at sea, in ports or ashore.
